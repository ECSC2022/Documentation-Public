All teams are required to join the Hacking-Lab discord server to coordinate with the organizers of the ECSC 22 competition. We will use the discord channel of each team to send a zip file containing the credentials to access the competition network. The purpose of the dry run event is not to run a full A/D CTF simulation. Instead, teams will have the opportunity to get familiar with the CTF network and understand how to fine-tune their infrastructures to match the CTF design. A detailed overview of the network topology and functionalities provided by the A/D CTF will be available shortly before the dry run event on the A/D CTF Platform Overview page. Teams will have 2 dummy services during the dry run event. These services are meant for teams to experiment with the infrastructure and do not reflect the level of complexity of final services. Despite their simplicity, they support all the main features of full-fledged services, i.e., flag ids and multiple flag stores . The dry run event will also be helpful to test the ticketing solution enabled in the Hacking-Lab discord server. Teams can try to open a ticket by following this procedure: Go to the #\ud83c\udd98ecsc-support channel Click on the envelope icon.

You will be challenged with attacks from other teams, availability problems, patches going wrong, sniffing network traffic, attacking other teams, and and and... If you have never played A/D, expect stressful situations. via GIPHY As the A/D CTF of ECSC 2022 will reuse components from the FaustCTF-Framework, we recommend their documentation as a first read. Notice, however, that the ECSC competition will slightly diverge from a traditional A/D CTF. The overall concept is detailed below on this page. Services Jeopardy CTFs are made of challenges, A/D CTFs of services . A service is a pseudo-realistic application affected by security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to extract some secrets, i.e., the flags , which serve as proof of successful hacking attempts. Services could consist of multiple components, each storing a different set of flags: we call such components flag stores . Flags can be bound to a specific flag ID that simplifies the identification of the target to exploit. For example, consider a service representing a Web forum where users can mark their threads as private. Users can also provide personal information in their profile. This information is only used for analytics and is not publicly shown to other users on the platform. Assume that flags are stored in 2 specific locations, representing the 2 flag stores of the service: as part of a private thread, as a field of their profile data. The flag ID for the 1st flag store could be the identifier of the private thread, while the user identifier could be used as a flag ID for the 2nd flag store. Expect 4 to 7 services , where each service will have one or more flag stores . A flag store can be exploited by one or more vulnerabilities . The number of flag stores of each service will be announced on the scoreboard, but we will not provide insights on the number, type, and expected difficulty of (intended) vulnerabilities. Game Design The game design is detailed in the A/D CTF Platform Overview page. A few important things that you may want to take into account: Like traditional A/D CTFs, the game keeps track of attack, defense, and SLA (i.e., the percentage of time the service is up and working as intended). The scoring formula is based on FAUST CTF and explained in the Scoring page. The game server checks the correct functionalities of each service once per round and places a new flag (different flag stores have different flags). The duration of a single round is 3 minutes , while flags are valid for 5 rounds . Teams are required to attack services of other contestants as in a traditional A/D CTF. Organizers do not run exploits against other teams for you. Teams have a limited access to their vulnerable machine. Additionally, there is a staging environment for testing/debugging and a production environment exposed to competing teams. Patch deployment takes place via git. Patches are not tested by organizers before deployment. A patch that breaks the service (e.g., by removal of intended functionality) will lower the SLA of the service. Anonymized traffic dumps (pcaps) of the services running in the production environment are provided. Human and Technical Behavior The goal of this competition is to allow participants to practice their skills and have fun. We want everyone to enjoy a fair game. For this reason, we ask you to follow these simple rules: No attacks against the infrastructure . Attempts to circumvent the limitations imposed by the CTF infrastructure are forbidden. We reserve the right to award extra points (and eternal fame) for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. Please open a ticket and inform us whenever you suspect that you are allowed to do specific actions that the infrastructure should have prevented. The production services of other teams are the only allowed targets for exploitation . Players are not allowed to attack competition infrastructure or any other portion of a team's network (inside or outside of the VPN). Attacking other participants' devices is severely prohibited and could lead to disqualification. Weaponizing 0/N-days against tools that other teams might use is also not allowed. No DoS . Causing unnecessarily high loads for CPU, traffic, memory, I/O, etc. on our infrastructure, other teams (including production, staging, and dashboard VMs), or any other party is strictly prohibited. Breaking another team's service through a sheer amount of requests is forbidden. Breaking it through logic vulnerabilities, flag deletion, etc., is not permitted. Generating fake flags is also disallowed. Sharing flags, exploits, or hints between teams is severely prohibited . During the competition, organizers will actively monitor the network traffic and record violations reported by participants. Violation of the rules or any other hostile behavior may lead to deduction of points or temporary exclusion from the competition by, e.g., sending RST packets or disconnecting a team for N rounds. Severe misconduct will be discussed with the Jury that could decide to permanently exclude a team from the CTF. Please, let's be nice. Despite these policies, all participants are responsible for the security of their own hardware and software. We will do our best to prevent malicious behavior, but we cannot guarantee other participants' behavior. ECSC organizers are not liable for any potential damage to your equipment. The rules listed on this page may change as more issues are raised by the participants. Also, the organizers keep the right to change them at any time. Please remember that it is impossible to list all rules and exceptions that apply to the CTF competition. When in doubt, use common sense or ask.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"ad_intro/#intro","text":"Attack / Defense (A/D) is the definition of chaos in the fantastic land of CTFs.

Each team has a dedicated portion of the subnet in the 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.0/24 address space. The first half of the team's subnet is reserved for services ( 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.0/25 ); the second half ( 10.10.1.128/25 ) is used by the players. Players have access to their and other team services (see below) but can not connect to other team players' subnets. Services do not have access to the Internet, players' laptops, or other services. A connection rate limit is in place to prevent players from DoS-ing services. If you receive connection drops, ensure you are not opening too many connections. All connections to services are tracked inside traffic dumps (PCAPs). Each team can download the pcaps for all their services. Scoreboard and Rounds The scoreboard is available at http://10.10.254.254/ . Flag ids are published as JSON at http://10.10.254.254/competition/teams.json . The round length is 3 minutes . Flags The flag format is ECSC_[A-Za-z0-9\\+/]{32} . Flags are valid for 5 rounds . The flag submission endpoint is at 10.10.254.254:31337 . It follows the same TCP-based protocol as FAUST CTF. A detailed description of the protocol specification can be found here . Upon connecting, the server will greet you with a welcome message, terminated with two newlines ( \\n\\n ). You can submit one or more flags per connection, separated by a single newline ( \\n ). The server will respond with a repetition of your submitted flag, a response code and an optional error message. The response codes the server may send are: OK : The flag was valid and will be counted towards your score. DUP : You previously submitted the same flag already. OWN : The flag belongs to your own team. OLD : The flag has expired and cannot be submitted any more. INV : The flag is invalid. ERR : The competition has not started or has already ended. An example conversation with the submission endpoint may look as follows. C and S indicate lines sent by the client and server, respectively. Each line includes the terminating newline ( \\n ).

This team is not displayed on the scoreboard, and attacks against it will not award points. The TEAM_ID of the NOP team is 1 . CTF-as-a-Service We are providing the computational resources to run the CTF-as-a-Service. Services are developed as docker containers and hosted on our platform. You can focus all your resources on exploiting and patching the vulnerabilities. Each team has 3 VMs available: 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.1 : Production environment 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.2 : Staging environment 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.3 : Dashboard Production environment Services running in production are the only ones counting towards exploitation, defense, and SLA. The production environment runs a copy of all services, and other teams and game bots can reach it. You do not have direct access to your production services, i.e., players of team X will not be able to connect to their services in the production environment. Therefore, you must rely on your superior patching skills to deploy the safest version of your services. Staging Environment It exposes a testing copy of each service that can be accessed only by members of the team, i.e., players of team X can connect to their services in the staging environment, while players of team Y are prevented from reaching staging services of team X. You can use staging to test all your patches, attempt to exploit a vulnerability, or admire the beautiful look of your services. Dashboard The dashboard is available at http://10.10.{TEAM_ID}.3/ and provides an overview of currently running containers. Selecting the corresponding environment, you can list information on either staging or production. In this view, you can access the logs or restart containers by clicking the related icons shown under Actions in the service table. PCAPs of all production services are also listed in the dashboard for download. Volume Explorer A SSH service is available with read-only access to the volumes of all services running in production and staging. You can connect as user user without password at 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.1:2222 (production) and 10.10.{TEAM_ID}.2:2222 (staging). All service volumes are available in the storage directory on the user's home. Example command: ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@10.10.1.1 -p 2222 Service Patching The service view in the team dashboard provides information on the different services, including the ssh://git@... address to clone these services into players' laptops. Furthermore, it offers the functionality to factory reset data volumes and deploy service images to either production or staging. To create a new image with a patched service: Upload your SSH Key through the dashboard (key icon on the lower left) Clone the service Add your patches Push the service Check the dashboard and wait for the build to finish Once the build has finished and succeeded, you can deploy the service to either Staging (S) or Production (P) by clicking the corresponding buttons under Deploy . Please notice that docker-compose.yaml files are provided only for local testing as they are not used in the remote deployment. Services can also specify in .protected_files.env a set of read-only files that are forbidden to be modified by teams. Commits trying to alter these files will be rejected during git push . Dockerfile is always among the protected files.","title":"Platform"},{"location":"ad_platform/#ad-ctf-platform-overview","text":"","title":"A/D CTF Platform Overview"},{"location":"ad_platform/#network","text":"A/D Network The competition takes place in the 10.10.0.0/16 subnet.

(The questions are answered by different teams / people - expect different answer styles :) ) How will the traffic dumps take place and what are the limitations to capturing traffic? We will provide downloadable pcaps. Could you provide us with a detailed scheme of the infra? Kindly wait for the dry run \u00bfIPV6 o IPV4? Attack / Defense is IPv4 Will have the teams Access to the GameBox or will we have to send the zip/tar of the patched challenge to the infra? Patching will take place via git, more details will be revealed during the dry run event. How is the submitter format? Standard TCP connection, one flag per line. How is the scape room going to work? How many countries per team? The draw for the teams and the time will be done at the welcome event. Teams will consist out of 4 Countries, the 5 guest countries will form a team of 5 Countries. How exactly works the scoring freeze? The scoreboard will stop updating 1 hour before the end on both days. There won\u2019t be a combined dashboard, to avoid leaking the first day. Will the tools required for the challenges be supplied by the organizers? There is no additional hardware required. Except a RJ45-Cable to connect to the network and if required a power adapter. Are we allowed to have our tools in addition to the player's laptop? If yes, what's the procedure? We added a new page: Hardware Requirements Is the HW part independent from the jeopardy challenges? Solving the hardware challenge will bring points in jeopardy, similar as last year. Which power plug do you have in austria? We use Type-F / Schuko plugs in austria, make sure you bring adapters / power strips if needed. Will there be a scheduled breaks during the competition? (ie. everyone has lunch/coffee break at the same time) if so, will the teams allowed to have lunch at once or in turns? No, this is not planned ! We start on both day\u00b4s at 08:30 and end at 18:00 local time. There will be fingerfood/snacks available the whole day as well as the army serves warm meals in between 11:30-15:00 direct in front oft the competition-hall. So it\u00b4s up to your team and your teams management how to plan there day. Will there be options for people with dietary restrictions? (vegan/vegetarian, gluten free, etc.) Definitely two options - vegan/vegetarian - regarding gluten free - will check and keep you updated. Will the catering be available during the whole event? Inbetween 11:30-15:00 and from 18:30 to 21:00. Is vaccination mandatory to participate in the event? (yes, we are aware of covid measures will be announced in september, however vaccination is another matter) Try to get all your team-members at the 2G status - at the moment there are NO restriction - but we don\u00b4t know what might happen until september - so 2G is probably the \"safest\" alternativ in both cases ! 2G means vaccinated or recovered - but as mentioned - at the moment there are no restrictions at all! Are the same measures applied for the press team of the participant country (if any), ie. catering, covid measures, ability to participate in the Austrian Army's conference, etc. The same measures/status for the visitors for the conference. Will we be provided with an \"Attack box\", for running exploit scripts? If not, is the game network only accessible through the RJ45 and will we need to bring our own switch to get more than 10? No, we will not provide an attack box. Teams are supposed to run exploits from their own laptops. If you want to have a dedicated laptop to launch exploits, you need to bring a switch with you to get more than 10 RJ45 ports. Will there be a \"NPC\" to attack and test exploits against, without revealing it in pcaps? Yes, there will be a NOP team that players can use to test their exploits without revealing attack traffic to other teams. Attacking the NOP team will NOT award points. Is there SLA on the staging environment, so we will know if a patch failed? We will not perform SLA checks in the staging environment Are players' machines reachable through the game network by default? Players in the same team can connect to each other, but connections between players of different teams are blocked. We received some questions on technical constraints of the CTF platform and code of conduct to adopt during the competition The game platform is designed to restrict super-human defenses. Technical limitations will be clarified during the dry run event and explained in the documentation. Concerning what you are allowed or not allowed to do, we will publish updated rules in the next few days. That said, teams are forbidden to subvert the CTF infrastructure/platform to gain an advantage against other players. Attacking the infrastructure is out of the scope of the competition. If you find a vulnerability in the infrastructure, please contact the organizers and report it: we will reward you accordingly and you will have our eternal gratitude. If you found a way to bypass one of the restrictions that does not exploit the infrastructure but, instead, leverages the design of a service, you may be allowed to use it. If you are unsure, please contact us during the competition by opening a ticket. Concerning the SLA: the scoreboard will keep track of the status of the SLA and provide additional information on why a test failed. We will not disclose the actual checks performed by the bots. On destructive behavior: we designed the CTF trying to limit the possibility of such events. Destructive behavior is forbidden. Borderline situations (e.g., exploiting a logic vulnerability in a service to make it fail an SLA check without deleting system files/flag or increasing the load) can be discussed individually during the competition. Please open a ticket and contact us. On rewriting services: teams are allowed to do so if they consider it a reasonable solution instead of patching the service. Is the usage of the two additional laptops restricted in any way? can we host our PCAP analysis software on them and/or the attack box? Is a VM running on one of the laptops bridged to the game network counted towards the 12 device limit? is there a limit on a real or virtual devices attached to the network? On laptops, VMs and local infrastructure: VMs are not counted. You have access to 10 physical ports, if you need more, you need to bring a switch. You can plan your local infrastructure the way you want using max 12 laptops. Is using a free trial of software allowed? Yes, if it is allowed by their license terms. How long do the rj45 cables we bring need to be? That\u2019s hard to answer, you will have a switch on your table, the table layout is visible on the venue page in section \"Seating\". Do external computers we own ourselves count as cloud resources? Can we SSH into our own computers at home? The cloud resources rule has been removed, feel free to use your home computers. More generally, what is a \u201ccloud resource\u201d? Where do you draw the line? Can we google? The cloud resources rule has been removed. What tools will be provided for the hardware chall? The hardware challenge itself. Could you give some examples of disallowed software? Are all commercial text-editors allowed? If a software you want to use is not on the list of allowed software, it\u00b4s disallowed. Please request an approval for all commercial software you want to use. Please send your question to patrick.pirker@cybersecurityaustria.at , if it is a question we can answer, we will disclose the answer to everyone here. Please collect your questions and send them in bulk , each email must contain your Team Name (Country) and your Role (Coach, Captain, Participant, ...)","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"We don\u00b4t answer individual questions regarding the competition, as we want to make sure, everyone has the same information. (The questions are answered by different teams / people - expect different answer styles :) ) How will the traffic dumps take place and what are the limitations to capturing traffic? We will provide downloadable pcaps. Could you provide us with a detailed scheme of the infra? Kindly wait for the dry run \u00bfIPV6 o IPV4? Attack / Defense is IPv4 Will have the teams Access to the GameBox or will we have to send the zip/tar of the patched challenge to the infra? Patching will take place via git, more details will be revealed during the dry run event. How is the submitter format? Standard TCP connection, one flag per line. How is the scape room going to work? How many countries per team? The draw for the teams and the time will be done at the welcome event. Teams will consist out of 4 Countries, the 5 guest countries will form a team of 5 Countries. How exactly works the scoring freeze? The scoreboard will stop updating 1 hour before the end on both days. There won\u2019t be a combined dashboard, to avoid leaking the first day. Will the tools required for the challenges be supplied by the organizers? There is no additional hardware required. Except a RJ45-Cable to connect to the network and if required a power adapter. Are we allowed to have our tools in addition to the player's laptop? If yes, what's the procedure? We added a new page: Hardware Requirements Is the HW part independent from the jeopardy challenges? Solving the hardware challenge will bring points in jeopardy, similar as last year. Which power plug do you have in austria? We use Type-F / Schuko plugs in austria, make sure you bring adapters / power strips if needed. Will there be a scheduled breaks during the competition? (ie. everyone has lunch/coffee break at the same time) if so, will the teams allowed to have lunch at once or in turns? No, this is not planned ! We start on both day\u00b4s at 08:30 and end at 18:00 local time.

Each competition will have a separate score, and the combined result of the two scores will determine the final scoreboard. Jeopardy Scoring The jeopardy competition will use the same dynamic scoring system you know from the previous years. All challenges will yield one or more flags at the end. Escape Room In terms of scoring, the Escape Room is part of the jeopardy competition. The Escape Room should not be all or nothing . Therefore teams can obtain points reflecting their progress. The Escape Room operator will hand out QR Codes (with flag strings) for every stage to teams, depending on their final progress. Teams are expected to submit these flags themselves on the jeopardy platform on dummy challenges (e.g., \"Escape Room Stage 1\", \"Escape Room Stage 2\", ...). These dummy challenges are again subject to dynamic scoring . Escape Room is solved by mixed teams (multiple countries). The draw for this teams will be done at the welcome event . Hardware Challenge As the hardware challenge will be part of the jeopardy competition, it will yield flags as any other jeopardy challenge. Attack-Defense Scoring Attack-Defense scoring is based on FaustCTF , as it proved in recent years to be almost linear, without creating significant gaps between teams. We only introduced minor changes to the formula to accommodate services with multiple flag stores. The final Attack-Defense score of each team is the sum of the team's scores for each individual service. The score for each service is the sum of three components: Offense: Points for flags captured from other teams and submitted to the submission endpoint before expiry. Defense: Points deduced for having your flags captured by other teams. SLA: Points for the availability and correct behavior of your services. Scores per Service For each service, the component scores for each team are calculated as follows: Offense points are calculated as: offense = count(flags_captured_by[team]) for flag in flags_captured_by[team]: offense += (1 / count(all_captures_of[flag])) Note : Since the points for each captured flag depend on the number of capturing teams, flags can degrade in value over time. This can result in a negative offense point delta being displayed on the scoreboard. Defense points are calculated as: defense = 0 for flag in flags_owned_by[team]: defense -= count(all_captures_of[flag]) ** 0.75 SLA points for each service are based on the lowest availability status of all flag stores of that service and the number of flag stores the service has (services with more flag stores give more SLA points). The SLA points are calculated as: sla = (count(ticks_with_status['up'] + 0.5 * ticks_with_status['recovering'])) * sqrt(count(teams)) * count(flag_stores_in_service) For example, if a service has two flag stores, the possible availability status are: Status Flag Store 1 Status Flag Store 2 Lowest Status Point Factor Description up up up 100% To get full points, all flag stores must be up. up recovering recovering 50% If one service is recovering and the rest are up or recovering, you obtain half the points for this round. recovering recovering recovering 50% same as above down/faulty - down/faulty 0% If any flag store is down or faulty, you obtain no points for the service in that round. Total Attack-Defense Score total = 0 for service in services: total += offense[service] + defense[service] + sla[service] Scoring Freezes We will freeze the scores on both competition days , to keep the excitement for the award ceremony. Combined Scoring Due to scoring freezes on both days, a real-time combined scoring would not reflect the participating teams' actual points and could be highly misleading. Therefore final combined scores will be announced after the competition. Combination of scores will follow the approach used by international cyber security challenge , as it is simple and has already proven to work well. normalized_score_ad = (top_score_jeopardy * score_ad) / top_score_ad final_score = score_jeopardy + normalized_score_ad For example: # top score of team X at the jeopardy CTF top_score_jeopardy = 4568 # top score of team Y at the A/D CTF top_score_ad = 29856 # scores of team Z score_jeopardy = 4219 score_ad = 25212 # normalization formula normalized_score_ad = (top_score_jeopardy * score_ad) / top_score_ad # final score of team Z final_score = score_jeopardy + normalized_score_ad # results for team Z >>> normalized_score_ad 3857.4630225080386 >>> final_score 8076.463022508038","title":"Scoring"},{"location":"scoring/#scoring","text":"There will be two competition days: jeopardy on the first day and attack defense on the second.

The SLA points are calculated as: sla = (count(ticks_with_status['up'] + 0.5 * ticks_with_status['recovering'])) * sqrt(count(teams)) * count(flag_stores_in_service) For example, if a service has two flag stores, the possible availability status are: Status Flag Store 1 Status Flag Store 2 Lowest Status Point Factor Description up up up 100% To get full points, all flag stores must be up. up recovering recovering 50% If one service is recovering and the rest are up or recovering, you obtain half the points for this round. recovering recovering recovering 50% same as above down/faulty - down/faulty 0% If any flag store is down or faulty, you obtain no points for the service in that round.","title":"Scores per Service"},{"location":"scoring/#total-attack-defense-score","text":"total = 0 for service in services: total += offense[service] + defense[service] + sla[service]","title":"Total Attack-Defense Score"},{"location":"scoring/#scoring-freezes","text":"We will freeze the scores on both competition days , to keep the excitement for the award ceremony.","title":"Scoring Freezes"},{"location":"scoring/#combined-scoring","text":"Due to scoring freezes on both days, a real-time combined scoring would not reflect the participating teams' actual points and could be highly misleading.
