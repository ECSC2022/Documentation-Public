You will be challenged with attacks from other teams, availability problems, patches going wrong, sniffing network traffic, attacking other teams, and and and... If you have never played A/D, expect stressful situations. via GIPHY As the A/D CTF of ECSC 2022 will reuse components from the FaustCTF-Framework, we recommend their documentation as a first read. Notice, however, that the ECSC competition will slightly diverge from a traditional A/D CTF. The overall concept is detailed below on this page. Services Jeopardy CTFs are made of challenges, A/D CTFs of services . A service is a pseudo-realistic application affected by security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to extract some secrets, i.e., the flags , which serve as proof of successful hacking attempts. Services could consist of multiple components, each storing a different set of flags: we call such components flag stores . Flags can be bound to a specific flag ID that simplifies the identification of the target to exploit. For example, consider a service representing a Web forum where users can mark their threads as private. Users can also provide personal information in their profile. This information is only used for analytics and is not publicly shown to other users on the platform. Assume that flags are stored in 2 specific locations, representing the 2 flag stores of the service: as part of a private thread, as a field of their profile data. The flag ID for the 1st flag store could be the identifier of the private thread, while the user identifier could be used as a flag ID for the 2nd flag store. Expect 4 to 7 services , where each service will have one or more flag stores . A flag store can be exploited by one or more vulnerabilities . The number of flag stores of each service will be announced on the scoreboard, but we will not provide insights on the number, type, and expected difficulty of (intended) vulnerabilities. Game Design We will announce more details during the A/D CTF simulation event . This documentation will be updated accordingly. Few important things that you may want to take into account: Like traditional A/D CTFs, the game keeps track of attack, defense, and SLA (i.e., the percentage of time the service is up and working as intended). The scoring formula is based on FAUST CTF . The game server checks the correct functionalities of each service once per round and places a new flag (different flag stores have different flags). The round duration will be announced later. Teams are required to attack services of other contestants as in a traditional A/D CTF. Organizers do not run exploits against other teams for you. Teams have a limited access to their vulnerable machine. Additionally, there is a staging environment for testing/debugging and a production environment . Patch deployment takes place via git. Patches are not tested by organizers before deployment. A patch that breaks the service (e.g., by removal of intended functionality) will lower the SLA of the service. Anonymized traffic dumps (pcaps) of the services running in the production environment are provided. A few additional considerations: The ultimate goal of the CTF is to be a fun and educational experience. DoSsing is lame and not fun . DoSsing attempts are strictly forbidden. Violations are recorded by organizers who decide which action to take, e.g., sending RST packets, disconnecting the team for N rounds, deducing points, etc. Please, be nice. Attacking the infrastructure is severely prohibited. Organizers welcome responsible disclosure.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"ad_intro/#intro","text":"Attack / Defense (A/D) is the definition of chaos in the fantastic land of CTFs.

Each competition will have a separate score, and the combined result of the two scores will determine the final scoreboard. Jeopardy Scoring The jeopardy competition will use the same dynamic scoring system you know from the previous years. All challenges will yield one or more flags at the end. Escape Room In terms of scoring, the Escape Room is part of the jeopardy competition. The Escape Room should not be all or nothing . Therefore teams can obtain points reflecting their progress. The Escape Room operator will hand out QR Codes (with flag strings) for every stage to teams, depending on their final progress. Teams are expected to submit these flags themselves on the jeopardy platform on dummy challenges (e.g., \"Escape Room Stage 1\", \"Escape Room Stage 2\", ...). These dummy challenges are again subject to dynamic scoring . Escape Room is solved by mixed teams (multiple countries). The draw for this teams will be done at the welcome event . Hardware Challenge As the hardware challenge will be part of the jeopardy competition, it will yield flags as any other jeopardy challenge. Attack Defense Scoring Attack Defense scoring will be based on FaustCTF , as it proved in recent years to be almost linear, without creating significant gaps between teams. However, small changes to the scoring system are necessary to accommodate some differences in the challenge design, e.g., multiple flag stores. The final formula will be provided later. Scoring Freezes We will freeze the scores on both competition days , to keep the excitement for the award ceremony. Combined Scoring Due to scoring freezes on both days, a real-time combined scoring would not reflect the participating teams' actual points and could be highly misleading. Therefore final combined scores will be announced after the competition. Combination of scores will follow the approach used by international cyber security challenge , as it is simple and has already proven to work well. normalized_score_ad = (top_score_jeopardy * score_ad) / top_score_ad final_score = score_jeopardy + normalized_score_ad For example: # top score of team X at the jeopardy CTF top_score_jeopardy = 4568 # top score of team Y at the A/D CTF top_score_ad = 29856 # scores of team Z score_jeopardy = 4219 score_ad = 25212 # normalization formula normalized_score_ad = (top_score_jeopardy * score_ad) / top_score_ad # final score of team Z final_score = score_jeopardy + normalized_score_ad # results for team Z >>> normalized_score_ad 3857.4630225080386 >>> final_score 8076.463022508038","title":"Scoring"},{"location":"scoring/#scoring","text":"There will be two competition days: jeopardy on the first day and attack defense on the second.
